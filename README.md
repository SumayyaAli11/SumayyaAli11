## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sumayya Ali

### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Data Scientist transitioning into full-stack AI engineering with a focus on cloud-native development and AI-driven applications. My journey began as a Math tutor, evolved through a Master’s in Data Science and Analytics, and is now deepening into areas like AI Agents, Large Language Models (LLMs), and cloud infrastructure.

This GitHub is a reflection of my hands-on learning from data analysis and ML pipelines to building intelligent systems using LangChain, FastAPI, and AWS. I'm passionate about bridging AI and software engineering through real-world, agentic, and scalable projects.
