## 👋 Hi there, I'm Sumayya Ali

### 🚀 About Me

I am a PhD researcher in Mathematics & Statistics, specialising in Bayesian modelling, uncertainty quantification, and climate risk analysis, with a research focus on estimating and projecting population exposure to extreme sea levels in Ireland. 

My background combines strong statistical theory with applied data science, grounded in real-world environmental and population data. I work primarily in R, building robust, reproducible statistical models, and I am actively expanding into Python to align my work with industry-grade analytics and production workflows.

My research and projects focus on:
- Translating complex statistical models into decision-relevant insights
- Quantifying and communicating uncertainty for policy, planning, and risk assessment
- Applying Bayesian, spatial, and extreme-value methods to real environmental challenges
